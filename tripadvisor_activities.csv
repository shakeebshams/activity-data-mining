Along with its regular burial sites, Arlington also offers customer-designed family estates, mausoleums that can hold from two to eight family members, and special burial estates near one of the park’s two picturesque lakes. Arlington Memorial Park has also created its own wilderness gardens, a natural area used exclusively for the placement of cremated remains. Arlington welcomes people of all faiths, with Jewish and Catholic sections also available. In addition, the park staff has many years of experience and takes great pride in maintaining a beautiful, tranquil setting. As an added convenience to our families, Arlington Memorial Park is associated with H.M. Patterson and Son Arlington Chapel and Sandy Springs Chapel, both of which are just down the road from Arlington Memorial Park. This association brings together three of the most highly regarded names in the funeral industry and makes it much easier for those pre planning funerals to cover all of the necessary details so that the deceased’s memory is honored in an appropriate fashion. We believe a memorial service should be as unique as the person it honors. In fact, we take great pride in creating perfectly personalized services that beautifully capture the essence of you or your loved one. We can help you find inspiration almost anywhere – in a song, a hobby, a trademark style, a defining philosophy, a lifelong passion – and turn that inspiration into a memorial service filled with thoughtful and meaningful details. You’ll find there’s no limit to the special tribute we can create so that your life – or the life of someone you love – is well celebrated.
