The Medalist Golf Club,4.5,"At the Medalist, you'll find a championship links-style 4 1/2 star course that has been exquisitely etched out of a landscape of almost 300 acres of rolling wooded land and wetlands. You're in South Central Michigan, but the terrain will carry you away in your mind to the state's northwoods. The Medalist has hosted many prestigious statewide events including the 2001 Women's State Championship, the 2010 Michigan State Junior Golf Championship, and the 2011 Michigan Junior State Amateur Championship. We have also hosted numerous USGA qualifiers including most recently United State Amateur Public Links qualifiers in 2009, 2010, and 2011. A day on our fairways is like a trip into the wilderness to play the game you love. Wild turkeys, deer, fox, sandhill cranes and even a rare white robin make their home here. There's even a bird sanctuary right down the street. In the midst of this scenic location, you'll be taking on a championship course created by Michigan's own Bill Newcomb. His handiwork is a must-play for the serious golfer who will find intriguing doglegs, split fairways, and wetlands, and ponds to carry. But this is a course for all generations and all the family to enjoy. With five sets of tees available on each hole, players of every level can enjoy Newcomb's handiwork. After you've experienced our winning style at The Medalist, golfing here will become your passion. And keep in mind, that The Medalist is an excellent location for your next golfing event.",15,http://www.themedalist.com,+1 269-789-4653,lweaver@themedalist.com,"15701 N Dr N, Marshall, MI 49068-9425",Marshall,MI,United States,42.35726,,7340166

The Medalist Golf Club,4.5,"At the Medalist, you'll find a championship links-style 4 1/2 star course that has been exquisitely etched out of a landscape of almost 300 acres of rolling wooded land and wetlands. You're in South Central Michigan, but the terrain will carry you away in your mind to the state's northwoods. The Medalist has hosted many prestigious statewide events including the 2001 Women's State Championship, the 2010 Michigan State Junior Golf Championship, and the 2011 Michigan Junior State Amateur Championship. We have also hosted numerous USGA qualifiers including most recently United State Amateur Public Links qualifiers in 2009, 2010, and 2011. A day on our fairways is like a trip into the wilderness to play the game you love. Wild turkeys, deer, fox, sandhill cranes and even a rare white robin make their home here. There's even a bird sanctuary right down the street. In the midst of this scenic location, you'll be taking on a championship course created by Michigan's own Bill Newcomb. His handiwork is a must-play for the serious golfer who will find intriguing doglegs, split fairways, and wetlands, and ponds to carry. But this is a course for all generations and all the family to enjoy. With five sets of tees available on each hole, players of every level can enjoy Newcomb's handiwork. After you've experienced our winning style at The Medalist, golfing here will become your passion. And keep in mind, that The Medalist is an excellent location for your next golfing event.",15,http://www.themedalist.com,+1 269-789-4653,lweaver@themedalist.com,"15701 N Dr N, Marshall, MI 49068-9425",Marshall,MI,United States,42.35726,,7340166

Castle Creek Country Club,3.0,"Nestled amidst the majestic foothills of Temecula's wineries and the world-famous Safari Park, Castle Creek Country Club is located in San Diego's North County, just 35 minutes north of downtown San Diego. Founded in 1948, Castle Creek Country Club is steeped in tradition. Originally opened as the Circle R Country Club, the club is home of the scenic Castle Creek Golf Course, a PGA approved, 18-hole championship golf course that offers a 5-star Southern California golf course experience at an affordable rate. The par 72 golf course was designed by Jack Daray, whose credits include Olympia Fields CC (home of the 2003 U.S. Open), and challenges golfers with oak-lined fairways, white sand bunkers, undulating greens and intermittent play over Moosa Creek, adding character and challenge to every hole. The temperate climate and sunny skies make this course a year-round golfers paradise. We offer men's, women's, and junior sets of tees and recently added a new set of championship tees to create a 6,638 yard course with a 72.00 rating and a 134 slope. Castle Creek Country Club is a great place to have fun with family and friends. The Gopher Hole sports bar offers numerous TVs throughout, 20 craft and standard beers on tap and entertainment on the weekends. In addition, The Gopher Hole offers scenic views of the golf course and rolling foothills from any seat in the house. Castle Creek Country Club is a great place for meetings, banquets, romantic weddings and other special events. All of our facilities have scenic views of the golf course and rolling foothills. At Castle Creek Country Club, we understand that our success depends on the satisfaction of our valued members and visitors, so we are committed to providing the greatest experience for you and your guests.

Shingle Creek Golf Club,4.0,"Shingle Creek Golf Club in Orlando, FL presents challenges to players of all levels and has consistently been rated as one of Orlando's best golf courses since opening in 2003. This Orlando golf course has a rich history, receiving its name from the creek that runs throughout the Shingle Creek Resort. Some of the earliest Central Florida settlers were attracted to the area because of wildlife, fishing, cypress trees, and of course the creek. At the time the creek was primarily used for logging cypress trees, which were transported down the river to a nearby mill. The trees were then processed into shingles, making shingle creek the perfect name for the course. The course is known for its large, undulating greens, plush fairways and an abundance of water hazards. Shingle Creek is also home to the Brad Brewer Golf Academy, one of the best golf instruction facilities in the nation. Brad Brewer has received numerous awards and recognitions, such as being ranked as a top 100 teacher by Golf Magazine and PGA class-A Professional. Our state-of-the-art practice facility provides Orlando golfers with everything they need to work on their game. Before playing a round we encourage players to fine tune their swing at the 70,000 sq. ft. driving range and to prepare for the tough greens on one of our three immaculate putting greens.

The Medalist has hosted many prestigious statewide events including the 2001 Women's State Championship, the 2010 Michigan State Junior Golf Championship, and the 2011 Michigan Junior State Amateur Championship. We have also hosted numerous USGA qualifiers including most recently United State Amateur Public Links qualifiers in 2009, 2010, and 2011.

There's even a bird sanctuary right down the street. In the midst of this scenic location, you'll be taking on a championship course created by Michigan's own Bill Newcomb. His handiwork is a must-play for the serious golfer who will find intriguing doglegs, split fairways, and wetlands, and ponds to carry. But this is a course for all generations and all the family to enjoy. With five sets of tees available on each hole, players of every level can enjoy Newcomb's handiwork.

You're in South Central Michigan, but the terrain will carry you away in your mind to the state's northwoods. The Medalist has hosted many prestigious statewide events including the 2001 Women's State Championship, the 2010 Michigan State Junior Golf Championship, and the 2011 Michigan Junior State Amateur Championship. We have also hosted numerous USGA qualifiers including most recently United State Amateur Public Links qualifiers in 2009, 2010, and 2011. A day on our fairways is like a trip into the wilderness to play the game you love. Wild turkeys, deer, fox, sandhill cranes and even a rare white robin make their home here. There's even a bird sanctuary right down the street. In the midst of this scenic location, you'll be taking on a championship course created by Michigan's own Bill Newcomb. His handiwork is a must-play for the serious golfer who will find intriguing doglegs, split fairways, and wetlands, and ponds to carry. But this is a course for all generations and all the family to enjoy. With five sets of tees available on each hole, players of every level can enjoy Newcomb's handiwork. After you've experienced our winning style at The Medalist, golfing here will become your passion. And keep in mind, that The Medalist is an excellent location for your next golfing event.",15,http://www.themedalist.com,+1 269-789-4653,lweaver@themedalist.com,"15701 N Dr N, Marshall, MI 49068-9425",Marshall,MI,United States,42.35726,,7340166

The Medalist Golf Club,4.5,"At the Medalist, you'll find a championship links-style 4 1/2 star course that has been exquisitely etched out of a landscape of almost 300 acres of rolling wooded land and wetlands. You're in South Central Michigan, but the terrain will carry you away in your mind to the state's northwoods. The Medalist has hosted many prestigious statewide events including the 2001 Women's State Championship, the 2010 Michigan State Junior Golf Championship, and the 2011 Michigan Junior State Amateur Championship. We have also hosted numerous USGA qualifiers including most recently United State Amateur Public Links qualifiers in 2009, 2010, and 2011. A day on our fairways is like a trip into the wilderness to play the game you love. Wild turkeys, deer, fox, sandhill cranes and even a rare white robin make their home here. There's even a bird sanctuary right down the street. In the midst of this scenic location, you'll be taking on a championship course created by Michigan's own Bill Newcomb. His handiwork is a must-play for the serious golfer who will find intriguing doglegs, split fairways, and wetlands, and ponds to carry. But this is a course for all generations and all the family to enjoy. With five sets of tees available on each hole, players of every level can enjoy Newcomb's handiwork. After you've experienced our winning style at The Medalist, golfing here will become your passion. And keep in mind, that The Medalist is an excellent location for your next golfing event.",15,http://www.themedalist.com,+1 269-789-4653,lweaver@themedalist.com,"15701 N Dr N, Marshall, MI 49068-9425",Marshall,MI,United States,42.35726,,7340166

This course creates a fun yet challenging day of golf. Known for its small greens, dramatic elevation changes, deep bunkers, and undulating fairways our Hills Course was designed by three-time U.S. Open Champion Hale Irwin. Surrounded by mountains and natural wildlife, the panoramic views of the Spanish Springs Valley are nothing short of breath taking. Other amenities available to golfers at Red Hawk include a full practice range with chipping and putting stations, practice bunkers, and a meticulously manicured 10,000 square foot practice green. Lessons, both private and group, are available from our golf professionals. One of Red Hawk’s crowning features is David’s Grill. Our diverse menu brings you extraordinary food and delicious libations pleasing the entire family with an irresistible of entrees. Open to the public every day but Christmas Day, David’s Grill offers breakfast, lunch, and dinner in a comfortable and friendly setting. Our dining room is home to an impressive collection of vintage and modern sports memorabilia, large stone fire places and large picture windows overlooking the 18th green. During the summer months, patio seating just off the Lakes Course is available and features live music on Friday and Saturday nights. Whether you want to unwind with a cold beer after a round of golf or bring the family in for a meal, the staff at David’s Grill will make you feel right at home. The Swim and Fitness Center at Red Hawk is a friendly and welcoming facility where active people come together to celebrate life and good health.

Apple Valley Golf Course,5.0,"Designed by noted golf course architect and Pinehurst native Dan Maples, Apple Valley stretches to nearly 6,800 yards and features expansive views of Bald Mountain and the surrounding Lake Lure area. Maples estimated that 75% of all shots at Apple Valley are either level or downhill, virtually unheard for a mountain course. Shimmering mountain lakes adorn 12 holes on Apple Valley, but water only occasionally comes into play. The back nine is widely regarded as one of the best closing stretches in the Western Carolinas. The par-3 14th hole, with its shallow green and back bunker, is reminiscent of No. 12 at Augusta National. Exhilarating par 5s abound throughout Apple Valley, including the straight-away downhill par-5 15th hole.

This philosophy is reflected in Bald Mountain’s playability from tee to reen. In contrast to Apple Valley, Bald Mountain is what many golf aficionados refer to as a “true North Carolina mountain course.” Elevation changes, particularly on the back, offer a beguiling mix of uphill and downhill shots amid a variety of doglegs and straight fairways.

Bald Mountain Golf Course,4.5,"Designed by W.B. Lewis, 6,300-yard Bald Mountain is renowned for its unique configuration of five par 5s and five par 3s. Movie buffs appreciate the 16th green, the backdrop of a scene from the movie “Dirty Dancing.” A protégé of golf course architect George Cobb, Lewis is known for his traditional approach to course design. This philosophy is reflected in Bald Mountain’s playability from tee to reen. In contrast to Apple Valley, Bald Mountain is what many golf aficionados refer to as a “true North Carolina mountain course.” Elevation changes, particularly on the back, offer a beguiling mix of uphill and downhill shots amid a variety of doglegs and straight fairways. The majority of green fronts are open, bringing both the ground and aerial game into play.",14,http://www.rumblingbald.com/golf-here/bald-mountain/,+1 828-694-3042,info@rumblingbald.com,"162 Mountain Blvd, Lake Lure, NC 28746-9852",Lake Lure,NC,United States,35.461067,,8559424
Apple Valley Golf Course,5.0,"Designed by noted golf course architect and Pinehurst native Dan Maples, Apple Valley stretches to nearly 6,800 yards and features expansive views of Bald Mountain and the surrounding Lake Lure area.

Shimmering mountain lakes adorn 12 holes on Apple Valley, but water only occasionally comes into play. The back nine is widely regarded as one of the best closing stretches in the Western Carolinas. The par-3 14th hole, with its shallow green and back bunker, is reminiscent of No. 12 at Augusta National. Exhilarating par 5s abound throughout Apple Valley, including the straight-away downhill par-5 15th hole. Rumbling Bald and Apple Valley are proud to be a part of North Carolina’s “First Family of Golf.” Dan Maples’ father, Ellis, was a prolific golf course designer and his grandfather, Frank, was Donald Ross’s superintendent at Pinehurst Resort.",16,http://www.rumblingbald.com/golf-here/apple-valley,+1 828-694-3043,info@rumblingbald.com,"309 Winesap Road, Lake Lure, NC 28746-8803",Lake Lure,NC,United States,35.453304,,8548795

We are a quick drive from Washington, D.C., a few miles north of Haymarket, and a few miles south of Middleburg. Where the typical golf course covers an area of around 125 or so acres, Bull Run stretches across more than 450. There is plenty of room here for the flora, fauna, and fish...as well as the golfers. Our renowned architect Rick Jacobson designed this course with the player in mind.

For the experienced player, the course offers interesting challenges and pro tees that will bring out your strongest game.

Bear Trace at Harrison Bay,4.5,"The second Bear Trace course to open, Harrison Bay is destined to become a true classic in this collection designed by Jack Nicklaus. Located approximately 20 minutes north of downtown Chattanooga, the Bear Trace at Harrison Bay is surrounded by both water and heavily-wooded land, making an ideal setting for the course. Referred to as “the best natural piece of land for a golf course,” the course features Champion Bermuda greens and 419 Bermuda fairways lined with soaring pine and hardwood trees. Although water touches 12 fairways, there is more than sufficient room to play safely. Most greens are open in front, which makes the course more user-friendly for high-handicap players and allows run-up shots. Fairway and greenside bunkers are designed in the traditional Nicklaus fashion and add notable character to the overall integrity of the course. Like other courses in the collection, the emphasis on playability is clearly evident.",22,http://www.tngolftrail.net/beartrace/harrisonbay/,+1 423-326-0885,,"8919 Harrison Bay Rd, Harrison, TN 37341-8935",Harrison,TN,United States,35.20222,,3653220
